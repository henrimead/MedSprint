4. Accounts & Authentication
MedSprint may operate without user accounts, with features tied to your device or app store identity. If we later introduce accounts, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activity under your account.

5. Subscriptions, Premium, Trials & In-App Purchases
5.1 Overview of Premium
MedSprint Premium is an optional, auto-renewing subscription that unlocks additional features such as (as available from time to time):
-  AI-generated GAMSAT- and MCAT-style questions and related study content;
-  advanced review, analytics, and feedback modes;
-  custom difficulty and question-count options;
-  early or exclusive access to new study tools, modes, and updates.
The availability and pricing of Premium may vary by region and currency.

5.2 Stores, Payment & Renewal
als, and billing are determined by the Store and displayed at purchase.
-  Payment will be charged to your Apple ID / Store account at confirmation of purchase.
-  Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
-  Your account may be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the rate shown at purchase (or as later updated in accordance with Store rules).
-  You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time via your device's Store subscription settings (e.g., Apple: Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions). Deleting the app does not cancel a subscription.

5.3 Free Trials
-  We may offer a free trial period for Premium. After it ends, your subscription will automatically convert to a paid plan unless cancelled before the trial expires.
-  Eligibility for free trials is determined at our discretion and may be limited to one trial per Apple ID / Store account or per user/device, even if you reinstall the app or change accounts.
-  Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited once a paid subscription is purchased, to the extent permitted by Store policy.

5.4 Refunds
-  All billing and refund processes for Premium are managed by the Store under its applicable policies. We cannot issue refunds or access your payment details directly.
-  For refund requests, please contact the Store (e.g., Apple: reportaproblem.apple.com) and follow its instructions.
-  Nothing in these Terms limits any rights you may have under applicable consumer laws.

5.5 Feature Tiers, Price & Changes

-  We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue Premium features, pricing, or tiers in whole or in part. Any significant changes will be communicated in-app and/or via the Store consistent with Store rules.
-  If required by the Store, you will be notified of price changes and given an opportunity to review them before they take effect. Continued subscription after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

6. Free Mode Quotas & Fair Use
-  Daily Limits. Free usage may be subject to daily quotas (e.g., number of questions or sessions). Quotas reset based on server-defined logic and/or your device's Store region time; details may vary by platform and are subject to change.
-  Anti-Circumvention. Attempts to bypass quotas (e.g., manipulating device time, using VPNs or automation tools, reinstalling repeatedly to obtain extra free use) are prohibited and may result in suspension or termination.
-  Abuse. Excessive usage patterns that degrade Service quality for others may be restricted.

7. AI-Generated Content Limitations
